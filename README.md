# Web Crawler and Search Engine Program

### Created by: Aidan Huang

This project is implemented with search engine algorithms and computations to provide the user with a list of ranked webpages based on a query input. These algorithms and computations include:
- PageRank Algorithm
- Vector Space Model and Cosine Similarity
- Term frequencies and Inverse Document Frequencies

A PDF report of the project is included, detailing the program design, time complexities, and space complexities.
